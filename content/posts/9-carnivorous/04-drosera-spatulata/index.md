Drosera spatulata is a carnivorous plant in the Droseraceae family that are native to Southeast Asia. They are fuzzy pet safe, but may catch small lizards and frogs when they are babies and not about to free themselves and should be kept away from these plants.

Drosera spatulata form small rosettes growing about two inches across in maturity, putting off bright pink flowers frequently (there will be no flowers on the ones that are shipped so that they can be shipped safely, however they will likely flower again shortly after getting settled in their new home). Their spoon shaped leaves produce a red dew that lures small bugs and insects who stop for a drink and get stuck and then the leaves of the sundew will gently wrap around the bug and absorb all of its nutrients, opening back up to have their little shells blown away or washed out by the next rain.

Plants should only be given rain, reverse osmosis water or distilled. Plants will arrive in one 2.5 inch deep pot, fully rooted and in the correct medium. Partially cold hardy, they should be protected from frost and brought inside if the temperatures are going to dip below freezing. Plants prefer bright, indirect light or limited full sun so that they donâ€™t burn up. Here they are kept in a bog under pine trees, mimicking the natural environment of the Venus Flytrap in both temperatures and location. These plants do not require dormancy and should be potted in a mix of peat and perlite and given boggy conditions, sitting in water that goes about a quarter inch up the side of the pot. Be sure to read the care guide included with your plant to ensure proper watering and care. Never fertilize or feed people food!
