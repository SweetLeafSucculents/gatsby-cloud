<strong>Syngonium podophyllum ‘Candy’</strong> is a dwarf version of the Syngonium Butterfly plant or Arrowhead Plant and is a member of the Araceae family. The Syngonium 'Candy' is larger than the super dwarf 'Mini Pixie' that we carry, but it also smaller than full size Syngonium. Syngoniums are toxic to furry pets, but there are mixed opinions from the plant community on their toxicity to reptiles.

Syngonium 'Candy' comes potted in a 3.5 inch plastic nursery pot, and can grow to be about three to six feet long in maturity as a vine. This is a full potted and rooted live plant. Not a cutting. In addition to getting longer, they do spread wider over time as new shoots come out of the rhizome.

Semi-tropical plant perfect for fairy gardens, terrariums and vivariums, miniworlds, and mini gardens, Syngonium 'Candy' are good for adding height and background plants in miniature scenes or makes a really cute house plant for tiny spaces, such as dorm rooms, apartments or small shelves for desks.

Syngonium mini pixies are cold hardy year round in Zones 9 - 10, and need to be insider before temperatures dip below 60 degrees. Plants enjoy bright indirect light but should avoid direct sunlight as it can burn their delicate leaves. Plants need moderate watering and for soil to be moist, but not soaked. While they enjoy being somewhat root bound, they should be repotted as needed when the plants spread. [For more detailed care instructions please refer to our care guide](/care/pixie/). 

Upon arrival, carefully remove all paper surrounding your leaves and cut out of the plastic baggie holding the dirt in and replace any dirt that has fallen out of the bag. Water, if needed, and acclimate your plant to the light. Your plant will have been on a long journey in the hands of people who do not care about it as we do, so it may need a day or two to perk back up.
