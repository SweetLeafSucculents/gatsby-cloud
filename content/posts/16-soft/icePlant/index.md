story: "Corpuscularia lehmannii (Ice Plant)"

---
Native to South Africa, Corpuscularia lehmannii (Ice Plant) has a deceptive nickname, as it is not cold hardy. If you live in a zone that gets colder than 30F, you should plant this the Ice Plant in a container that can be moved indoors. The Ice Plant does well in either full or partial sun; and when it is indoors, it's best to keep it near a sunny window. 

In it's native South African habitat, the Ice Plant is largely water-deprived. Likewise, you should water you Ice Plant sparingly, when the soil has entirely dried out. When you do water, try to make sure the soil is completely soaked. This will allow your plant to soak up enough water to carry it through until the next "downpour," as it would in it's native habitat.
